This folder contains the models used to analyze Copycat robustness.

The same [OD](OD.txt.7z) dataset was used to train all original models (target models).<br>
The only difference between it and the ODD used to other experiments is that it is shuffled.<br>
The file [train.mean](../data/FER7/train.mean) and [TD.txt](../data/FER7/TD.txt.7z) are the same files used in [FER7](../data/FER7)
