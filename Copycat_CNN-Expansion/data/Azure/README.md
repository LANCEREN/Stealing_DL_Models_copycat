The Analysis of Attack was performed on [Emotion API from Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/emotion-api/) using different subsets of NPDD (Random Natural Images).

The NPDD was distributed in the same way that Data Curve experiments:
* [NPDD with 1k images replicated to Copycat training](NPD_SL-0.1mi-aug.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 1k images](NPD_SL-0.1mi.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 5k images replicated to Copycat training](NPD_SL-0.5mi-aug.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 5k images](NPD_SL-0.5mi.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 1M images replicated to Copycat training](NPD_SL-1.0mi-aug.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 1M images](NPD_SL-1.0mi.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 1.5M images replicated to Copycat training](NPD_SL-1.5mi-aug.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 1.5M images](NPD_SL-1.5mi.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 3M images replicated to Copycat training](NPD_SL-aug.txt.7z)
* [NPDD with 3M images](NPD_SL.txt.7z)

The performances were measured by the Macro Average on the same Test Domain Dataset (TDD) used by FER7:
* [TDD](../FER7/TD.txt.7z)
