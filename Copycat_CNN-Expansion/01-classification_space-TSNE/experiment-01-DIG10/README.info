Firstly, 1000 examples per class were selected from ODD.
The vectors referred to are in:
-> DIG10-OD-1000.txt

After, 200000 examples were selected from NPDD.
The vectors referred to are in:
-> DIG10_Original_NPD-a.txt, DIG10_Original_NPD-b.txt

Then the examples per class was counted and 1700 vectors
per class were maintained:
-> DIG10-NPD-1700.txt

To obtain T-SNE chart, run the following command:
$ ./tsne.py DIG10-OD-1000.txt DIG10-NPD-1700.txt
