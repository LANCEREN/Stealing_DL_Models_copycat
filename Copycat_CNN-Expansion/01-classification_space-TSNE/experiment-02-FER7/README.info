Firstly, 1000 examples per class were selected from ODD.
The vectors referred to are in:
-> FER7-OD-1000.txt

After, 200000 examples were selected from NPDD.
The vectors referred to are in:
-> FER7_Original_NPD-a.txt, FER7_Original_NPD-b.txt

Then the examples per class was counted and 3200 vectors
per class were maintained:
-> FER7-NPD-gray-3200.txt

To obtain T-SNE chart, run the following command:
$ ./tsne.py FER7-OD-1000.txt FER7-NPD-3200.txt
